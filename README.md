        <h2> Why??</h2>
        <p> Because Norway is the <em>bestttt</em> at <strong>everything</strong></p>
        <h2> Any songs in Norway?</h2>
        <p id = "NW">I once had a girl <br>
Or should I say she once had me<br>
She showed me her room<br>
Isn't it good Norwegian wood?<br><br>
She asked me to stay<br>
And she told me to sit anywhere<br>
So I looked around<br>
And I noticed there wasn't a chair<br><br>
I sat on a rug biding my time<br>
Drinking her wine
We talked until two and then she said<br>
"It's time for bed"<br><br>
She told me she worked<br>
In the morning and started to laugh<br>
I told her I didn't<br>
And crawled off to sleep in the bath<br><br>
And when I awoke I was alone<br>
This bird had flown<br>
So I lit a fire<br>
Isn't it good Norwegian wood?<br></p>
<h2> But this isn't a Norwegian song!!</h2>
<p> You're right.. but it's still cool, let me show you more things about Norway 
    <li> Prison is great!
    <li>No one is bad
    <li>It's fun </li>
    I donÂ´t know what to do anymore, thank you for watching
